Figure out while $href->{'content'} exists but ${$href->{'content'}} is undef in revision nodes.

Create module sub which deletes an given entry.

Rethink node entry representation. (incl. OO, etc.)

Add option to support large content of single nodes: 
    - Maybe: headers only, content is read buffer size wise and direct written
      to outfile
    - Maybe: content is read buffer size wise. Filter can process the buffers
      one by one. Filters have to call function to read new buffer or short
      circuit the rest of the content input direct to the output file.
