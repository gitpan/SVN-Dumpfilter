SVN-Dumpfilter version 1.00
===========================

SVN::Dumpfilter filters a Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) dumpfile.
The file is parsed and a call-back subfunction is called with a hash-reference for
every 'node'. This function can modify, add or delete headers, properties and
the content of the node. After processing of the call-back function the node is
re-assembled and stored in an output file.

The parse and re-assemble processes are done by dedicated subfunctions which
can be also exported ('internal' tag) for special filters (e.g. merging filter
which has to write the output file by its own).
